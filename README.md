# Team VIS 2026 Wiki

The main language used to write wikis in this repository is `Markdown`.

This repository **MUST** contain all coding assets to generate your team's wiki
(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc).

Images, photos, icons and fonts **MUST** be stored on `static.igem.wiki` using
[the uploads tool](https://teams.igem.org/go/deliverables/wiki/uploads), and Videos **must** be embedded from
[iGEM Video Universe](https://video.igem.org); see [the Video & Audio page](https://teams.igem.org/go/deliverables/wiki/videos-and-audios) for guidance on adding video and audio.

**Everything your wiki loads (CSS, JavaScript, fonts, images) must be served from
iGEM infrastructure.** Do not link to external or third-party CDNs (for example
Google Fonts, jsDelivr, cdnjs) — upload the files you need via
[the uploads tool](https://teams.igem.org/go/deliverables/wiki/uploads) and reference them from `static.igem.wiki`
instead.

For up-to-date requirements, resources, help and guidance, visit
[teams.igem.org/go/deliverables/wiki](https://teams.igem.org/go/deliverables/wiki).

> results, data, or citations.

## Getting started

You should probably only edit the files inside folders `static`, `wiki` and
`docs`.

1. Open the Web IDE
2. Make the changes on the files you wish:
   - For the menu, change the file [menu.html](wiki/menu.html)
   - For the layout, change the file [base.html](wiki/base.html)
   - For the pages, change the corresponding file in the folder [docs](docs)
3. Review the changes you made
4. Once you are done, save the changes by **committing** them to the _main
   branch_ of the repository
5. An automated script will build, test and deploy your wiki, which should take
   less than 30 seconds.

## About this Template

### Files

The static assets are in the `static` directory. The layout and templates are in
the `wiki` directory, and the pages live in the `docs` directory. Unless you are
an experienced and/or adventurous human, you probably shouldn't change other
files.

    |__ docs/               -> Documentation files
        |__ *.md            -> Markdown files with the content of your wiki
    |__ static/             -> static assets (CSS and JavaScript files only)
    |__ wiki/               -> Main directory for the pages and layouts
        |__ base.html       -> Main layout of your wiki. All the pages will follow its structure
        |__ footer.html     -> Footer that will appear in all the pages
        |__ menu.html       -> Menu that will appear in all the pages
    |__ .gitignore          -> Tells GitLab which files/directories should not be uploaded to the repository
    |__ .gitlab-ci.yml      -> Automated flow for building, testing and deploying your website.
    |__ .prettierignore     -> Tells Prettier which files/directories should not be formatted
    |__ .prettierrc.json    -> Prettier configuration file
    |__ LICENSE             -> License CC-by-4.0, all wikis are required to have this license - DO NOT MODIFY
    |__ README.md           -> File containing the text you are reading right now
    |__ app.py              -> Python code managing your wiki
    |__ dependencies.txt    -> Software dependencies from the Python code
    |__ package-lock.json   -> Lockfile that captures the exact versions of NPM packages used for formatting
    |__ package.json        -> NPM dependencies for formatting the code

### Building locally (advanced users)

To work locally with this project, follow the steps below.

#### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org) `>=3.10` (3.12 recommended). Check yours with
  `python3 --version`.
- (Optional) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) `>=18` if you want to format the
  templates with Prettier.

#### Install

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.igem.org/2026/vis.git
cd vis
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate # on Linux, MacOS; or
. venv\Scripts\activate # on Windows
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

#### Execute

```bash
python app.py
```

#### Format (optional)

The repository ships with a Prettier setup that formats the Jinja templates,
Markdown pages, CSS and JavaScript. Install the Node dependencies once and then
run the `format` script whenever you want to tidy the files:

```bash
npm install
npm run format
```
