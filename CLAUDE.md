# Notes for AI assistants

Read **[README.md](README.md)** first — it covers the stack, where to edit
(`docs/*.md`), build/serve commands, and the iGEM asset rules (images via the
uploads tool, videos from iGEM servers, no external CDNs).

## Responsible & honest use

## Guardrails
- Don't change `LICENSE` or the footer's license notice + GitLab repository link
  (both required on every page for judging).
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` works as-is; change it only if you know what you're doing —
  any build/deploy issues that result are the team's responsibility.
